            ECOMMPAY is an international fintech company with main offices based in Moscow & Riga, as well as regional ones in London, Singapore etc.
            We are a B2B business offering online payments acquiring & processing services for other businesses. Our solutions aim at both bigger & smaller companies.
            G2025 (aka Gate Two) is the latest & up to date core system that facilitates the functioning of our solutions to the majority of our clients.
            G1 (Gate One) is the remnant of the first several years of the ECOMMPAY’s existence that still serves as the main biais of integration for a significant part of our clients.
            We are strongly dedicated to fully migrate all of our clients from G1 to G2025 in the nearest future in order to get rid of the outdated G1 infrastructure & to focus all of our efforts on enhancing our G2025 architecture &
            versatility.

            The first one is the “Payment Page” solution, which is roughly a ready to use module that can be easily built into any web page &/or application.
            The second one – the “API” (application programming interface). This method requires a more sophisticated integration that Is only possible if our client has got a dedicated team of developers on one’s side. Yet in exchange this
            solution opens much broader & versatile possibilities in controlling both inwards & outwards transactions. However, we demand a certain set of data safety certificates proving their responsibility, as the “API” integration reveals
            sensible details of the end-users to our clients.
